### Built with

### What I learned

- i learned about VH(view height) and VW(view width) CSS units which are relative to the visible screen size and how to use it

for example

```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  //100 vh - the elements take 100% of the viewport height-wise
}
```

- also i learned about the box-sizing CSS property and used it in the challenge
